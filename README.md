Template files and CSS for my website https://repkam09.com


This README file will also document some of the required packages that I use for various parts of the website so that I can remember what I've done and to help speed up deployment should I need to configure a new server in the future.


Current server hosting is provided through a DigitalOcean VPS running Ubuntu 15.04.

This is a rewrite of the website using some dynamic feature of reactjs instead of PHP!
This repository can also be found on my Gogs deployment here: https://dev.repkam09.com/repkam09/website-react/
